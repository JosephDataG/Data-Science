## Background

Hello! 

My name is Sarah Fuchi and welcome to my Portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Electrical Engineering and have been working as a Quality Engineer at Fatolko Electronics for the last 5 years. On my free time, I do what I am passionate about which is Data Science and it's applications. This repo summarizes my selected repositories, the ones my cat "Baldo" approves of.
