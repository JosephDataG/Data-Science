# Project Overview

The rapid growth of data collection has led to a new era of information. Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.

They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and sucees.

# Types of recommendation systems

There are basically three types of recommender systems:-

- Demographic Filtering- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.

- Content Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.

- Collaborative Filtering- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.

# About Dataset
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?

This is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.

# Data Sets

I worked with two datasets: tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv

The first dataset contains the following features:

- movie_id - A unique identifier for each movie.
- cast - The name of lead and supporting actors.
- crew - The name of Director, Editor, Composer, Writer etc.

The second dataset has the following features:

- budget - The budget in which the movie was made.
- genre - The genre of the movie, Action, Comedy ,Thriller etc.
- homepage - A link to the homepage of the movie.
- id - This is infact the movie_id as in the first dataset.
- keywords - The keywords or tags related to the movie.
- original_language - The language in which the movie was made.
- original_title - The title of the movie before translation or adaptation.
- overview - A brief description of the movie.
- popularity - A numeric quantity specifying the movie popularity.
- production_companies - The production house of the movie.
- production_countries - The country in which it was produced.
- release_date - The date on which it was released.
- revenue - The worldwide revenue generated by the movie.
- runtime - The running time of the movie in minutes.
- status - "Released" or "Rumored".
- tagline - Movie's tagline.
- title - Title of the movie.
- vote_average - average ratings the movie recieved.
- vote_count - the count of votes recieved.

I joined the two datasets on the 'id' column.

```
df1.columns = ['id','tittle','cast','crew']
df2= df2.merge(df1,on='id')
```

Take a look at the data: 
```
df2.head(5)
```
![First look at the data](/images/movie/movie1.jpg)

I found [this paper](https://www.ijert.org/research/recommender-systems-types-of-filtering-techniques-IJERTV3IS110197.pdf) very helpful to gather information regarding recommendations systems and the filtering techniques. Then I looked at three types of filtering techniques :

# Step 2: Demographic Filtering

Demographic filtering (DF) categorizes people and recommends services based on their demographic information. In DF, user profiles are built by categorizing individuals into archetypal descriptions that describe the characteristics of different user groups. [This paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022850703159) contains further information. Demographic data reveals people who are interested in similar services. DF is used by semi-trusted third parties to recommend services based on data about specific consumers.

The cumulative buying behavior or preferences of customers within these categories are tracked by DF, which builds groupings of users with comparable demographic traits. For a new user, suggestions are created by first determining which category he belongs to, and then applying the cumulative purchasing preferences of prior users to that category. Demographic techniques, like collaborative techniques, establish "people-to-people" connections but with different data. A collaborative and content-based technique necessitates a history of user ratings, which the Demographic approach does not.

We need a measure that allows us to: 
- score or rate a movie 
- calculate the score for each movie 
- order the scores and propose the highest rated movie to users

As a result, I'll use IMDB's weighted rating (wr), which is as follows:

![IMDB's weighted rating (wr)](/images/movie/movie3.jpg)

where, v is the total amount of votes for the movie. m is the minimum number of votes required to be included in the chart. The movie's average rating is R, and the average vote for the entire report is C.

We already have v(vote count) and R (vote average), so C is simple to calculate:

```
C= df2['vote_average'].mean()
C
```

6.092171559442011

As a result, the average rating for all of the movies is around a 6 on a scale of 10. The next step is to choose an appropriate value for m, which is the number of votes needed to be included in the chart. As a cutoff, we'll choose the 90th percentile. To put it another way, a movie must receive more votes than at least 90% of the other movies on the list in order to be included in the charts.

```
m= df2['vote_count'].quantile(0.9)
m
```

1838.4000000000015

We may now filter out the movies that are eligible for the chart.

```
q_movies = df2.copy().loc[df2['vote_count'] >= m]
q_movies.shape
```

(481, 23)

There are 481 movies that meet the criteria for inclusion in this list. Now we must determine our metric for each qualified movie. To accomplish so, we'll create a weighted rating() function and a new feature score, the value of which will be calculated by applying this function to our DataFrame of qualified movies:

```
def weighted_rating(x, m=m, C=C):
    v = x['vote_count']
    R = x['vote_average']
    # Calculation based on the IMDB formula
    return (v/(v+m) * R) + (m/(m+v) * C)
```

```
# Define a new feature 'score' and calculate its value with `weighted_rating()`
q_movies['score'] = q_movies.apply(weighted_rating, axis=1)
```

Finally, sort the DataFrame by the score feature and output the top 10 movies' title, vote count, vote average, and weighted rating or score.

```
#Sort movies based on score calculated above
q_movies = q_movies.sort_values('score', ascending=False)

#Print the top 15 movies
q_movies[['title', 'vote_count', 'vote_average', 'score']].head(10)
```
![Top 15 movies](/images/movie/movie4.jpg)

We've made our first (although rudimentary) recommendation. We can identify movies that are very popular under the Trending Now tab of these systems, and we can get them by sorting the dataset by the popularity column.

```
pop= df2.sort_values('popularity', ascending=False)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))

plt.barh(pop['title'].head(6),pop['popularity'].head(6), align='center',
        color='skyblue')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.xlabel("Popularity")
plt.title("Popular Movies")
```

Text(0.5,1,'Popular Movies')

![Popular movies](/images/movie/movie5.jpg)

Please take into account that these demographic recommenders give all users with a generic chart of recommended movies. They are indifferent to user's preferences and interests. This may be fixed when we switch to a more advanced system called Content Based Filtering.
